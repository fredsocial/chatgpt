ChatGPT Requests

Please note:

You need to replace "your-api-key" with your actual OpenAI API key.
The endpoint URL https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/chatgpt-model-name/completions is a placeholder. You should replace it with the actual endpoint provided by OpenAI for ChatGPT.
The parameters like max_tokens might need adjustment based on your specific requirements.
This script assumes a simple JSON response structure. The actual structure may vary based on the OpenAI API's design.
Always ensure you comply with OpenAI's use-case policy and API usage limits when using their API.
